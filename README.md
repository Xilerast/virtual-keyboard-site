# Virtual keyboard for websites

This is NOT a project I did on my own. I followed the steps in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3cq0BHDMOY). I did, however, move the keys accordingly on my own so that "Done" will be on the end of the second row, and "shift" where "done" is in their project. The color is also different.
